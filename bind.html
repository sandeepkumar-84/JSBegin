        // to the elements of the html as they are designed. The requirement is to include all the react class properties to be avaiable 
        // as this to the   elements like button above when it is clicked. usually on the caller context is avaiable. 

        // for example when above button is clicked only the button context will be present in the this parameter in its click handler
        // however when added bind in the eventlistner will make all the properties of the class , like server etc as conext to this in the clicked event
